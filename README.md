# Abstract Art Generator

Welcome to the **Abstract Art Generator**! This is a small web application that allows users to create abstract art dynamically by interacting with a canvas. The project combines **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Python** (using Flask) to provide a unique and interactive experience.

This is my first time using Python in a project, even if it's a small one! ðŸŽ‰
